## This repo contains:
* This README
* A jQuery dyanmic web app that allows you to search the current weather and multiple data points such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV index, as well as a 5 day forecast.
* A vanilla css stylesheet, and the jQuery file weather.js

## Known Issues / Bugs
* After searching for a new city, you are unable to click any of the history items to search for the data.
* The limit on search history items is uncapped, so it can get to a very long length and cause rendering problems.

## What I Learned:
* Creating my own CSS stylesheet made me think about the layout of the page when designing it.
* jQuery allows for rapid development of your web application and simplifies what usually would take much more work using vanilla JS.
* Breaking down any re-usable code into a function makes it more readable easier to code

## Conclusion:
* I need to keep improving my javascript scope knowledge as well as looking into JS best practices for improving my code.
